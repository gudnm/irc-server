# irc-server

Some IRC server functionality (namely PING, NAME and QUIT commands) implemented in Python as an exercise in networking/sockets and OOP design.

It served as a toy platform for several pair-programming sessions. Unfortunately, the changes were not version controlled and what you see here is the last (but not necessarily the best) version of the OOP structure.
